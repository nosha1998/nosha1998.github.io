        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>The United Kingdom has historically played a leading role in developing parliamentary democracy and in advancing literature and science. At its zenith in the 19th century, the British Empire stretched over one-fourth of the earth's surface.</p>

        <p> The first half of the 20th century saw the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>'s strength seriously depleted in two world wars and the Irish Republic's withdrawal from the union. The second half witnessed the dismantling of the Empire and the UK rebuilding itself into a modern and prosperous European nation. As one of five permanent members of the <abbr title="United Nation">UN</abbr> Security Council and a founding member of <abbr title="North Atlantic Treaty Organization">NATO</abbr> and the Commonwealth, the UK pursues a global approach to foreign policy. </p>

        <p>The UK has been an active member of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> since its accession in <time datetime="1973">1973</time>, although it chose to remain outside the Economic and Monetary Union. However, motivated in part by frustration at a remote bureaucracy in Brussels and massive migration into the country, UK citizens on <time datetime="2016-06-23">23 June 2016</time> narrowly voted to leave the EU. The UK is scheduled to depart the EU on <time datetime="2020-01-31">31 January 2020</time>, but negotiations on the future EU-UK economic and security relationship will continue throughout <time datetime="2020">2020</time> and potentially beyond.</p>
